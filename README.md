# Sunsure Agents Web Application

## Overview
This is a web application for general purposes by Sunsure agents to add, edit, delete, and search for client information. It primarily
serves to provide agents with the ability to insert, update and search for policyholders. In addition to this, agents are able to insert

to help improve the overall user interface and experience.
